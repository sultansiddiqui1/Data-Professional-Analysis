# Data-Professionals Analysis Project
A Project fully made in PowerBI,which means even the data cleaning and standardizing is done in Power BI.This is a real world project, where the raw data is taken from the instagram survey done by Alex the Analyst via his instagram stories, where he asks the data professions questions about their professions like Job Title, pay range etc and also personal questions like preffered programming language and age and country of origin.

**Loading and Transforming the data in PowerBI:**
  - Rather than simply loading the data we put it in the Power Query Editor so that we can transform and clean      some of the columns that need some work. It is better to do this in excel or sql, but since we want to          really see what all we can do in PowerBI we do it here for this project.
  - Next, i delete a few columns that i am sure i will not be using. PowerBI tracks the changes that i do and       also gives me the option of undoing them, so worst case if i need the columns again, i can get them back.
